            Welcome! I'm Gjergji, and my journey into web development began a
            year ago when I started learning JavaScript. From the very first
            line of code, I was hooked. <br />
            <br />I quickly realized that programming isn’t just about solving
            problems—it’s about building, creating, and constantly evolving.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            As I progressed, I discovered React, and everything clicked. The
            ability to craft dynamic, scalable, and interactive applications
            fueled my passion even more. <br />
            <br />
            I’ve spent countless hours learning, experimenting, and pushing
            myself to improve every day. While I may not have professional
            experience yet, I thrive on challenges and learn incredibly fast.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            Every project I build is a step toward mastering my craft, and I
            can’t wait to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a real-world team.
